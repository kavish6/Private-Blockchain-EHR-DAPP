# Private-Blockchain-EHR-DAPP
## Overview:
This is a Decentralized application to store and access electronic health records. This project uses hyperledger fabric to create a private blockchain to store health records.
This solves the problem of storing sensitive information present in electronic health records as this project uses a private blockchain which is created using hyperledger fabric.
The private network has two hospital organizations and one orderer organization.

### Technologies used:
- The user interface of this application is created using react.js and material ui.
- The backend api(application javascript) is created in javascript using node.js and express.js which connects the client application to the network and calls the deployed contract's functions
- The chaincode(smart contract) is created using javascript
- This project uses docker to emulate the nodes and certificate authorities for different organizations.
- The main blockchain network is created using Hyperledger fabric
